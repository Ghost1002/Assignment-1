Question 1:
What will the code below output to the console and why ? 
1)console.log(1 + "2" + "2"); 
ANS: The code outputs the text “122” to the console, demonstrating a concatenation of a string and an integer.
2)console.log(1 + +"2" + "2"); 
ANS: The code outputs the text “32” to the console, since 1 + +”2” becomes 1+2=3 and then the demonstrating a concatenation of string (“2”) and integer (3)
3)console.log(1 + -"1" + "2"); 
ANS: The code outputs the text “02” to the console, since 1+ -1 becomes 0 and then becomes 02 due to concatenation of string and integer. 
4)console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2"); 
ANS:112
Because +”1” becomes 1 and due to concatenation of strings it becomes 112
5)console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");
ANS:NaN2
Because “A”-“B” becomes NaN and concate (+) 2 which becomes NaN2.
6)console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);
ANS:NAN
Because “A”- “B” becomes NaN and NaN + 2 becomes NaN

Question 2:
You are given a variable “marks”. Your task is to print: 
- AA if the mark is greater than 90 
- AB if the mark is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90 
- BB if the mark is greater than 70and less than or equal to 80 
- BC if the mark is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70 
- CC if the mark is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60 
- CD if the mark is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
 - DD if the mark is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40 
- FF if the mark is less than or equal to 30

               else if(marks>40 && marks<=50)

               {
                   console.log("DD");
               }
               else
               {
                   console.log("FF");
               }

                    </script>

OUTPUT:
CD
